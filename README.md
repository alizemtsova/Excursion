# Excursion
This is a study project done during Codecademy.

In this project, I created a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” I was implementing my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. 

The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so the video and landscape imagery were used to set the scene.
